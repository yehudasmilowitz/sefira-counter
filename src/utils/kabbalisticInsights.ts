    dvarTorah: "The Alter Rebbe teaches in Tanya (Chapter 32) that the foundation of all divine service is אהבת ישראל. Just as Hashem's love for us is infinite and unconditional, so too must our love for our fellow Jews be. The Baal Shem Tov adds that this love is the key to bringing the Shechinah into our midst.\n\nThe Chofetz Chaim zt\"l explains that when we love another Yid, we're actually loving a piece of Hashem Himself, since every Jewish neshama is a cheilek Eloka mima'al. This is why the Alter Rebbe emphasizes that אהבת ישראל is the foundation - because through loving our fellow Jews, we're actually connecting to Hashem Himself."

Just as a parent's love must include discipline to guide their child, so too must our love for Hashem include יראה. The Rebbe Rashab teaches that this combination creates a love that is both passionate and enduring.\n\nThe Sfas Emes brings down that גבורה שבחסד is like a father who disciplines his child with love. The discipline itself is an expression of love, because without proper boundaries, love can become destructive. This is why the Torah tells us 'את ה' אלוקיך תירא' - our fear of Hashem must be rooted in love, and our love must be tempered with fear."

When our love and discipline are in perfect balance, our divine service becomes a beautiful garden that brings nachas to Hashem.

Even when there are obstacles, the water finds a way around them. Similarly, our acts of kindness must be constant and persistent, finding ways to continue even when faced with challenges.

The Maggid of Mezritch adds that this gratitude is what enables us to serve Hashem with joy. The Rebbe explains that when we recognize Hashem's kindness, we naturally want to reciprocate through our divine service.\n\nThe Sfas Emes explains that הוד שבחסד is like a beautiful crown that we wear when we recognize Hashem's kindness. Every act of kindness we receive is like another jewel in the crown.

Just as יסוד connects all the sefiros above it to מלכות below, so too does our kindness connect us to Hashem and enable us to influence the world. The Rebbe adds that this foundation of kindness is what enables all other aspects of our divine service to flourish.\n\nThe Noam Elimelech explains that יסוד שבחסד is like the foundation of a building. Without a strong foundation, the building cannot stand. Similarly, without a foundation of kindness, our divine service cannot stand. This is why the Torah tells us 'חסד ה' מלאה הארץ' - Hashem's kindness is the foundation of the world, and our kindness must be the foundation of our service."

The Baal Shem Tov adds that true leadership comes from a place of humility and kindness. The Rebbe Rashab explains that this combination enables us to be a proper vessel for Hashem's kindness to flow through us to others.\n\nThe Chiddushei HaRim explains that מלכות שבחסד is like a king who leads with kindness. A true king doesn't rule through force, but through love and kindness. Similarly, when we lead with kindness, we become proper vessels for Hashem's kingship in the world.

The Tzemach Tzedek adds that this combination creates a proper balance in our divine service. The Rebbe teaches that when we approach our spiritual boundaries with love, they become not restrictions but opportunities for growth.\n\nThe Sfas Emes explains that חסד שבגבורה is like a father who disciplines his child with love.

The Baal Shem Tov adds that this strength comes from recognizing that these boundaries are expressions of Hashem's love. The Rebbe Rashab explains that this double gevurah enables us to overcome all obstacles in our divine service.\n\nThe Noam Elimelech explains that גבורה שבגבורה is like a fortress that protects us from spiritual harm. The stronger the fortress, the better it can protect us. Similarly, when we strengthen our spiritual boundaries, we become better protected from negative influences.

The fence itself becomes part of the garden's beauty when it's properly maintained. Similarly, when we approach our spiritual boundaries with discipline, they become beautiful expressions of our connection to Hashem.

    maaseh: "Strengthen your faith through study of Chassidus",
    dvarTorah: "The Tzemach Tzedek explains that יסוד שבמלכות represents the foundation of our connection to Hashem. Just as יסוד connects all the sefiros above it to מלכות below, so too does our leadership connect us to Hashem and enable us to influence the world. The Rebbe adds that this foundation of leadership is what enables all other aspects of our divine service to flourish.\n\nThe Noam Elimelech explains that יסוד שבמלכות is like the foundation of a fortress. Without a strong foundation, the fortress cannot protect us. Similarly, without a foundation of leadership, our spiritual service cannot protect us from negative influences. This is why the Torah tells us 'שומר מצוה לא ידע דבר רע' - when we maintain strong spiritual boundaries, we are protected from harm."

The Tzemach Tzedek adds that this leadership comes from a place of humility and nobility. The Rebbe teaches that when we approach our spiritual boundaries with humility and nobility, we naturally want to influence and elevate others positively.\n\nThe Chiddushei HaRim explains that מלכות שבמלכות is like a king who leads with nobility. A true king doesn't rule through force, but through nobility and majesty. Similarly, when we lead with nobility, we become proper vessels for Hashem's kingship in the world. This is why the Torah tells us 'מלך במשפט יעמיד ארץ' - true leadership comes through nobility and justice."
